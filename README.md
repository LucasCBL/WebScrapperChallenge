Hi, this Readme file is going to be both a log of my decisions during this test and if necessary a guide on how to run my code, although this will be secondary.


The first main decision was choosing the language, I juggled between doing it in c# which is the language im most familiar with and Python, which I believe to be more apt for this specific challenge, in the end due to time constraints I am going with python, since I know it will be faster due to how powerful the python libraries are for this type of challenges. The downside of this is that it may end up becoming too easy and unhelpful in what is supposed to be a showcase of my technical skills, unfortunately I only have today available in the 72h period I was given to accomplish this test, so I will approach the problem with a focus on having a MVP ready and then if I have the time for it I will either expand upon it or make another version completely.

To start I will just create a basic test that checks if the scrapper when given the url returns anything resembling an html, to check this I will just check if it has a html ending tag.

Since I'm not familiar with unit testing in python I will directly pass the test before doing a commit, as I need to make sure I know how to do it for the rest of the challenge.

After this I will make the first commit and start making tests for the rest of the tasks before continuing any development.
